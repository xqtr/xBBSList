# xBBSList
Automatic BBS List App.

This is a project for BBSes. Its an app that collects info from a JAM base and populates a list with BBSes.

The admin of the BBS has to upload his info file once per day (or more). The app will scan a specific JAM base, get the info file and update its database.
This way, users who visit a BBS that runs this app, will get a list of BBSes that are online... so the list is valid.
